## Project Description

**FPGA-Based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with 7-Segment Display Interface**

This project implements an 8-operation, 5-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed for the Xilinx Basys 3 FPGA (xc7a35tcpg236-1). The ALU processes two 5-bit two's complement inputs and supports eight arithmetic and logical operations, selectable via a 3-bit opcode. User inputs are provided through onboard switches, and results are displayed as signed decimal numbers on the 7-segment display. Status LEDs indicate overflow and other ALU flags.

**Key Features:**
- **ALU Core:** Performs addition, subtraction, increment, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and other operations as defined in the ALU module.
- **Two's Complement Arithmetic:** Supports signed operations from -16 to +15.
- **Visual Output:** Multiplexed 7-segment display shows results; LEDs indicate overflow and status.
- **Clock Management:** Includes a clock divider for stable display multiplexing.
- **Hardware Mapping:** Utilizes Basys 3 onboard resources for inputs (switches), outputs (7-segment display, LEDs), and clock.

**Design Hierarchy:**
- **top_module:** Instantiates the ALU and display controller modules.
- **ALU:** Executes the selected operation.
- **display_controller:** Converts binary results to display signals, including sign handling.

This project demonstrates modular digital design, finite state machine control for display, and practical FPGA I/O integration.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Vivado Design Suite:** This project was created and verified with **Vivado v2025.1 (64-bit)**. While it may work with other versions, it is recommended to use the same one to ensure compatibility.

## Project Recreation

This repository does not contain a standard Vivado project file (`.xpr`). Instead, it uses a Tcl script to allow for a clean, portable, and version-control-friendly structure. Follow these steps to recreate the project on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/placidocordeiro/ALU-Verilog.git
```

**2. Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd [ALU-Verilog]
```

**3. Recreate the Vivado Project**

The entire Vivado project can be generated by running the provided Tcl script.

- Open the **Vivado Tcl Shell** (recommended) or a standard terminal where the `vivado` command is in your system's PATH.
- Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
vivado -mode batch -source ./tcl/ALU-Verilog.tcl
```

This command will execute the script in batch mode, creating a new directory named `ALU-Verilog/` (or your project's name) which contains the complete, ready-to-use Vivado project.

**4. Open the Project**

You can now open the newly created project in the Vivado GUI. The project file will be located at:

`./ALU-Verilog/ALU-Verilog.xpr`

**Important:** The generated project directory (`ALU-Verilog/`) is intentionally untracked by Git, as specified in the `.gitignore` file. All your work should be done on the source files located in the `src/`, `constraints/`, and `sim/` directories.

## Version Control Methodology

Standard Vivado projects are difficult to manage with version control systems like Git. They generate numerous temporary files, logs, and user-specific configuration data, leading to bloated and non-portable repositories.

This project adopts a **script-based, non-project mode** methodology, which is a best practice for collaborative and professional FPGA development.

- **What is Versioned:** Only the essential source files are committed to the repository:
    - HDL source code (`.v`, `.vhd`) in the `src/` directory.
    - Constraint files (`.xdc`) in the `constraints/` directory.
    - Simulation sources in the `sim/` directory.
    - The Tcl script (`.tcl`) that rebuilds the entire project.

- **What is Ignored:** The entire Vivado-generated project directory is ignored. This ensures the repository remains lightweight, clean, and independent of any user's local machine configuration.

This approach guarantees that every developer can perfectly replicate the project environment from a "single source of truth", the versioned files.
